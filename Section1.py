# Introduction to algorithms
# In this section, we will be learning about what an algorithm is.
# An algorithm is a finite, unambiguous sequence of instructions for performing a certain task.
# In this section, we will be learning three types of algorithms:
# 1) Karatsuba's multiplication algebra
# 2) Algorithm for converting from decimal number to binary number
# 3) Euclidean algorithm
