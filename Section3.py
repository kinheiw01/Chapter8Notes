In this section, we will be introducing to pseudocode. But what is pseudocode?
Pseudocode is an informal notation for writing instructions that is closer to natural language. 
It makes no reference to any particular programming language.
To make sure the code works, we need to translate from pseudocode to the programming language accordingly.

In this section, we will learn the pseudocode of:
1) If-then blocks (We have seen a few)
2) For loops
3) While loops (We have seen one)
