Before we start, let's understand how a standard long-multiplication algorithm.
For example, the following:
Let:
1) m = 10a + b
2) n = 10c + d

mn = (10a + b)(10c + d) =  100ac + 10(ad + cb) + bd

Asumme that mn = 23, n = 31, then:
a = 2
b = 3
c = 3
d = 1

Try to do it using the long multiplication from primary school!
