What is a variable in algorithm? 
A variable is a string of one or more letters that acts as a placeholder that can be assigned different values.

What is a string?
A string algorithm is showing the display of letters or numbers. However, it cannot operate with operators in Python's string.

In algorithm  (Not Python), we use the notation (<-) to assign value to a variable, such as:
x <- 3

In python, it is written as:
x = 3

We can write a whole bunch of combined formulas!!
Try the following exercise
1) Write an algorithm to find the first six terms of the arithmetic sequence with first term 10 and common difference 7.
2) Write it in a table

The following code is showing how the code is written in Python
"""
a = 10 # Initial value
d = 7 # Common difference
t = 5 # Number of times (Extra: Why does it have to be 5 times, not 6?)

result = a + d*t

print("Result = ",result)
